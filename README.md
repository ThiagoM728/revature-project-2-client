This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.3.

## Fair Breeze Career Fair Facilitator
The purpose of this project is to provide a means for students and companies to connect more easily with regards to Career Fair participation. Henceforth we will refer to the application as FB.

**Student Features** <br> <br>
Students using FB will enjoy the following features: <br>
-- Creating a student profile <br>
-- Searching for companies attending a given career fair <br>
-- Viewing the open positions (referred to in the application as job listings) an attending company has <br>
-- Searching for open positions by job type (full-time, part-time, internship), associated tags, or name <br>
-- Favoriting an open position, thus adding it to their personal "Favorites" page <br>
-- Viewing a map of any given career fair event, allowing them to quickly find companies at the career fair in which they are               interested <br> <br>

**Company Features** <br> <br>
Companies using FB will enjoy the following features: <br>
-- Creating a company profile <br>
-- Creating a new job listing: the job listing will contain information on the job title, location of the job, the company department the position is in, the job type, a brief description, and any tags (keywords) associated with the position that may help the student search for the position on the job listing page <br>
-- Viewing the job listings they are displaying to students <br>
-- Deleting job listings <br>
-- Viewing career fair events to which they can RSVP <br>
-- RSVP-ing to a specific career fair event; during which they can select the specific booth they will be in during the event <br>
